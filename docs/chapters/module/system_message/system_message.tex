\s{system\_message}

\ss{Purpose}
This module provides \tbf{system message} customization.

\begin{note}{What is called system message?}
    All the messages inside the mojang's official language file are called system message, such as: \href{https://github.com/sakurawald/fuji-fabric/blob/dev/.github/files/en_us.json}{en\_us.json for minecraft 1.21}
    \\
    \\
    Here are some messages that are system message:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item player join and leave server message
        \item player advancement message
        \item player death message
        \item player command feedback
        \item player whitelist message
    \end{enumerate}
\end{note}

\begin{note}{Server-side message and Client-side message}
    It should be noted that, no all messages inside mojang's official language file are server-side message.
    If a message is client-side message, which means that the message is only used in client-side, then the module will have no effects on this message.
