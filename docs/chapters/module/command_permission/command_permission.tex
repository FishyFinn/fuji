\s{command\_permission}

\ss{Purpose}
This module provides the customization of \tbf{the requirement of any commands}.

\ss{How it works}
The vanilla minecraft use a command system called brigadier.\\
All the commands are registered, parsed and executed by brigadier. \\
In this system, all commands are build into a tree structure. \\
For example, like the command /gamemode creative Steve is composed by 3 command node:
\begin{description}
    \item [literal command node] gamemode
    \item [argument command node] a valid gamemode
    \item [argument command node] a valid player
\end{description} And the command node path stands the tree node path. \\
For /gamemode creative Steve, the path is ["gamemode", "gamemode", "target"]. \\
Also, each command node has its requirement, which is a condition to check if the command user can use the command node. \\
This module can override the requirement of a command node into a permission with prefix fuji.permission.<command\_node\_path>.

\begin{tips}{Query all the registered command path}
    You can query a command path using /lp group default permission set fuji.permission\ldots way.
\end{tips}

\ss{Example}
\begin{example}{Allow everyone to use /op command}
    \ic{/lp group default permission set fuji.permission.op true}
\end{example}
