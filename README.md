# Introduction
Fuji is a minecraft mod that provides many essential and useful modules for vanilla survival.

> **_If minecraft gets updated, you can mail sakurawald@gmail.com for fuji update reminder._**

> This is a **server-side only** mod, but you can use it in a **single-player world**. (Yes, the single-player world also includes a logic-server)
> - For a server-maintainer: You only need to install this mod at the server-side, and the players don't need to install this mod at their client-side
> - For a player: You only need to install this mod at the client-side, and then you can use the modules in your single-player world.

# Feature
1. **Vanilla-Respect**: all the modules do the least change to the vanilla game (Never touch the game-logic).
2. **Fully-Modular**: you can disable any module completely if you don't like it (The commands and events will all be disabled, just like the code never exists, without any performance issue).
3. **High-Performance**: all the codes are optimized for performance, and the modules are designed to be as lightweight as
   possible (From data-structure, algorithm, lazy-load and cache to improve performance greatly).
4. **Easy-to-Use**: all the modules are designed to be easy to use, and the commands are designed to be easy to remember, even the language file is designed to be easy to understand.
