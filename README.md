# Description
Fuji is a minecraft mod that provides many essential and useful modules for vanilla survival.

> **_If minecraft gets updated, you can mail sakurawald@gmail.com for fuji update reminder._**

> This is a **server-side only** mod, but you can use it in a **single-player world**. (Yes, the single-player world also includes a logic-server)
> - For a server-maintainer: You only need to install this mod at the server-side, and the players don't need to install this mod at their client-side
> - For a player: You only need to install this mod at the client-side, and then you can use the modules in your single-player world.

# Feature
1. **Vanilla-Respect**: all the modules are designed to be as light-way as possible, and do the least change to the vanilla game. (Never touch the game-logic.)
2. **Fully-Modular**: you can disable any module completely if you don't like it. (Code is data is code. Thanks to the power of meta-programming, the module loader will even not load and inject the module text into the game, if you disable the module, without any performance issue.)
3. **High-Performance**: Keep performance in mind while coding. (From data-structure, algorithm, lazy-evaluation and cache to improve performance greatly.)
4. **Easy-to-Use**: a text-based per-field-explained auto-generated always-up-to-date documentation is provided. (Our configuration use lots of mini-language and generators to provide a unified setup.)
